This directory contains the complete source code for QUADPACK, as
obtained from NETLIB (http://www.netlib.org).  In addition, it
contains one routine (DGTSL) from LINPACK and a few routines (XERROR
and friends) from CMLIB, all obtained from NETLIB.

Since numerical integration of functions usually requires passing in a
function to the integration routine, using a foreign function
interface for this can be difficult if the function to be integrated
is in Lisp.  Hence, we convert the code from Fortran to Lisp.

The directory Fortran contains the Fortran source.  This is a useful
test for f2cl since it's a fairly large and complete package.

To test for proper conversion, try compiling tst-dqagse.lisp and
running the tests therein.  These are some simple test integrals taken
from the Quadpack book and were designed to show how well quadpack
works and where it fails.
