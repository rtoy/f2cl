2D diurnal kinetics-transport PDE system with 2 species
Spatial mesh is 10 by 10
Method flag is mf = 22   Tolerances are rtol = 0.1D-04   atol = 0.1D-02
Left preconditioner uses block-diagonal part of Jacobian
Root function finds stationary points of total ozone,
  i.e. roots of (d/dt)(sum of c2 over all mesh points)
