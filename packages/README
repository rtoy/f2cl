The packages here are not officially part of f2cl.  They come from
various sources and are used to test f2cl.  They've been a great way
of finding bugs and inadequacies in f2cl.  If they're also useful
packages, that's just a side benefit. :-)

Packages:

quadpack	Adaptive integration package

minpack		Minimization package
		  Software for solving nonlinear equations and
		  nonlinear least squares problems.

hompack		Homotopy package
		  Subroutines for solving nonlinear systems of
		  equations by homotopy methods.  There are
		  subroutines for fixed point, zero finding, and
		  general homotopy curve tracking problems, utilizing
		  both dense and sparse Jacobian matrices, and
		  implementing three different algorithms: ODE-based,
		  normal flow, and augmented Jacobian.

blas		BLAS Basic Linear Algebra System
		  (Only a subset)

odepack		A set of solvers for initial value problem for
		ordinary differential equation systems.

fishpack	Solution of elliptic partial differential equations

toms		Tranactions on Mathematical Software
 715		Algorithm 715:  specfun

 717		Algorithm 717:  Subroutines for ML and Quasi-ML
		Estimation for Parameters in Nonlinear Regression
		Models.

 419		Algorithm 419:  cpoly
