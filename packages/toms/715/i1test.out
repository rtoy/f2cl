1Test of I1(X) vs Multiplication Theorem


   2000 Random arguments were tested from the interval ( 0.00, 1.00)


 I1(X) was larger   644 times,
           agreed   679 times, and
      was smaller   677 times.


 There are  53 base   2 significant digits in a floating-point number


 The maximum relative error of    0.6505E-015 =    2 ** -50.45
    occurred for X =0.336543E+000
 The estimated loss of base   2 significant digits is   2.55


 The root mean square relative error was    0.1856E-015 =    2 ** -52.26
 The estimated loss of base   2 significant digits is   0.74

1Special Tests


 Test with extreme arguments

 I1(XMIN) = 0.11125369292536007E-307

 I1(0) = 0.00000000000000000E+000

 I1(-.55568624803404972E-001 ) = -.27795038081849317E-001

 I1(0.55568624803404972E-001 ) = 0.27795038081849317E-001

 E**-X * I1(XMAX) = 0.29754474593158999E-154

 Tests near the largest argument for unscaled functions

 I1(0.69235162141875753E+003 ) = 0.73282458365806542E+299

 I1(0.73629972238772166E+003 ) = 0.17900000000000000E+309

 This concludes the tests.
