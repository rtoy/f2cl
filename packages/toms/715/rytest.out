1Test of Y(X,ALPHA) vs Multiplication Theorem


   1989 Random arguments were tested from the interval ( 0.00, 2.00)


 Y(X,ALPHA) was larger   849 times,
                agreed   422 times, and
           was smaller   718 times.


 NOTE: first  11 arguments in test interval skipped
       because multiplication theorem did not converge


 There are  53 base   2 significant digits in a floating-point number


 The maximum relative error of    0.2737E-014 =    2 ** -48.38
    occurred for X =0.192225E+001 and NU =0.550330E+000
    with Y(X,ALPHA) = 0.162225E+000
 The estimated loss of base   2 significant digits is   4.62


 The root mean square relative error was    0.3628E-015 =    2 ** -51.29
 The estimated loss of base   2 significant digits is   1.71

1Check of Error Returns


 The following summarizes calls with indicated parameters

 NCALC different from MB indicates some form of error

 Tests near the largest acceptable argument for RYBESL

 RYBESL will be called with the arguments0.335544E+0080.500000E+000
 NCALC returned the value    2
 and RYBESL returned U(1) = 0.296749E-004

 RYBESL will be called with the arguments0.536871E+0090.500000E+000
 This should trigger an error message.
 NCALC returned the value   -1
 and RYBESL returned U(1) = 0.000000E+000

 This concludes the tests.
