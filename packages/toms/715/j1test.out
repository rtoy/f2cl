1Test of J1(X) VS Maclaurin expansion


   2000 random arguments were tested from the interval (  0.0,  1.0)


 ABS(J1(X)) was larger   471 times
                agreed   745 times, and
           was smaller   784 times.


 There are  53 base   2 significant digits in a floating-point number.


 The maximum relative error of    0.4630E-015 =    2 ** -50.94
    occurred for X =0.241570E+000
 The estimated loss of base   2 significant digits is   2.06


 The root mean square relative error was    0.1574E-015 =    2 ** -52.50
 The estimated loss of base   2 significant digits is   0.50

 Test with extreme arguments



 J1 will be called with the argument 0.1797693135E+309
 This may stop execution.


 J1 returned the value 0.00000000000000000E+000

 This concludes the tests.
