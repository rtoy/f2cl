1Test of GAMMA(X) vs Duplication Formula


   2000 Random arguments were tested from the interval (  0.000,  2.000)


 GAMMA(X) was larger   505 times,
              agreed   866 times, and
         was smaller   629 times.


 There are  53 base   2 significant digits in a floating-point number


 The maximum relative error of    0.4409E-015 =    2 ** -51.01
    occurred for X =0.987698E+000
 The estimated loss of base   2 significant digits is   1.99


 The root mean square relative error was    0.1308E-015 =    2 ** -52.76
 The estimated loss of base   2 significant digits is   0.24

1Special Tests




 Test of special arguments


 GAMMA (-.500000E+000) = -.354491E+001


 GAMMA (0.224755E-307) = 0.444929E+308


 GAMMA (0.100000E+001) = 0.100000E+001


 GAMMA (0.200000E+001) = 0.100000E+001


 GAMMA (0.169908E+003) = 0.266542E+305


1Test of Error Returns



 GAMMA will be called with the argument-.100000E+001
 This should trigger an error message


 GAMMA returned the value0.179000E+309



 GAMMA will be called with the argument0.000000E+000
 This should trigger an error message


 GAMMA returned the value0.179000E+309



 GAMMA will be called with the argument0.222507E-307
 This should trigger an error message


 GAMMA returned the value0.179000E+309



 GAMMA will be called with the argument0.171624E+003
 This should trigger an error message


 GAMMA returned the value0.179000E+309



 This concludes the tests
