1Test of I(X,ALPHA) vs Multiplication Theorem


   2000 Random arguments were tested from the interval ( 0.00, 2.00)


 I(X,ALPHA) was larger   807 times,
                agreed   489 times, and
           was smaller   704 times.


 There are  53 base   2 significant digits in a floating-point number


 The maximum relative error of    0.1959E-014 =    2 ** -48.86
    occurred for X =0.158844E+001 and NU =0.129939E+000
 The estimated loss of base   2 significant digits is   4.14

1Check of Error Returns


 The following summarizes calls with indicated parameters

 NCALC different from MB indicates some form of error

 See documentation for RIBESL for details

 RIBESL will be called with the argument-.100000E+001
 This should trigger an error message.
 NCALC returned the value   -1
 and RIBESL returned the value0.000000E+000

 Tests near the largest argument for scaled functions

 RIBESL will be called with the argument0.999878E+004
 NCALC returned the value    2
 and RIBESL returned the valueNaN          

 RIBESL will be called with the argument0.100012E+005
 This should trigger an error message.
 NCALC returned the value   -1
 and RIBESL returned the value0.000000E+000

 Tests near the largest argument for unscaled functions

 RIBESL will be called with the argument0.708913E+003
 NCALC returned the value    2
 and RIBESL returned the value0.112931E+307

 RIBESL will be called with the argument0.709087E+003
 This should trigger an error message.
 NCALC returned the value   -1
 and RIBESL returned the value0.000000E+000

 This concludes the tests.
