1Test of LGAMA(X) vs LN(2*SQRT(PI))-2X*LN(2)+LGAMA(2X)-LGAMA(X+1/2)


   2000 Random arguments were tested from the interval (  0.0,  0.9)


  LGAMA(X) was larger   578 times,
               agreed   893 times, and
          was smaller   529 times.


 There are  53 base   2 significant digits in a floating-point number


 The maximum relative error of    0.6164E-015 =    2 ** -50.53
    occurred for X =0.869815E+000
 The estimated loss of base   2 significant digits is   2.47


 The root mean square relative error was    0.1461E-015 =    2 ** -52.60
 The estimated loss of base   2 significant digits is   0.40


1Test of LGAMA(X) vs LN(2*SQRT(PI))-(2X-1)*LN(2)+LGAMA(X-1/2)-LGAMA(2X-1)


   2000 Random arguments were tested from the interval (  1.3,  1.6)


  LGAMA(X) was larger   808 times,
               agreed   522 times, and
          was smaller   670 times.
