1Test of Y1(X) VS Multiplication Theorem


   2000 random arguments were tested from the interval (  0.0,  4.0)


 ABS(Y1(X)) was larger   643 times
                agreed   578 times, and
           was smaller   779 times.


 There are  53 base   2 significant digits in a floating-point number.


 The maximum relative error of    0.9456E-015 =    2 ** -49.91
    occurred for X =0.214071E+001
 The estimated loss of base   2 significant digits is   3.09


 The root mean square relative error was    0.2002E-015 =    2 ** -52.15
 The estimated loss of base   2 significant digits is   0.85

 Test with extreme arguments



 Y1 will be called with the argument 0.2225073859E-307
 This should not stop execution.


 Y1 returned the value-0.28611174857570283E+308

 Y1 will be called with the argument -.1000000000E+001
 This may stop execution.


 Y1 returned the value-0.17900000000000000E+309

 Y1 will be called with the argument 0.1797693135E+309
 This may stop execution.


 Y1 returned the value 0.00000000000000000E+000

 This concludes the tests.
