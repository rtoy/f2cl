1Test of Y0(X) VS Multiplication Theorem


   2000 random arguments were tested from the interval (  0.0,  3.0)


 ABS(Y0(X)) was larger   817 times
                agreed   591 times, and
           was smaller   592 times.


 There are  53 base   2 significant digits in a floating-point number.


 The maximum relative error of    0.7624E-015 =    2 ** -50.22
    occurred for X =0.279636E+001
 The estimated loss of base   2 significant digits is   2.78


 The root mean square relative error was    0.2105E-015 =    2 ** -52.08
 The estimated loss of base   2 significant digits is   0.92
