1Test of anorm(x) vs double series expansion


   2000 Random arguments were tested from the interval ( -0.663,  0.663)


  ANORM(X) was larger   253 times,
               agreed  1595 times, and
          was smaller   152 times.


 There are  53 base   2 significant digits in a floating-point number


 The maximum relative error of    0.4237E-015 =    2 ** -51.07
    occurred for X =-.637105E+000
 The estimated loss of base   2 significant digits is   1.93


 The root mean square relative error was    0.8569E-016 =    2 ** -53.37
 The estimated loss of base   2 significant digits is   0.00

 Test of special arguments


 ANORM (0.179769E+309) = 0.100000E+001


 ANORM (0.000000E+000) = 0.500000E+000


 ANORM (-.179769E+309) = 0.000000E+000


 Test of Error Returns



 ANORM will be called with the argument -.281395E+002
 The result should not underflow


 ANORM returned the value0.160919E-173



 ANORM will be called with the argument -.375194E+002
 The result may underflow


 ANORM returned the value0.000000E+000



 This concludes the tests
