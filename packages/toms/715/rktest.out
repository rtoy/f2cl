1Test of K(X,ALPHA) vs Multiplication Theorem


   2000 Random arguments were tested from the interval ( 0.00, 1.00)


 K(X,ALPHA) was larger   665 times,
                agreed   649 times, and
           was smaller   686 times.


 There are  53 base   2 significant digits in a floating-point number


 The maximum relative error of    0.1418E-014 =    2 ** -49.32
    occurred for X =0.999094E+000, NU =0.545233E+000 and IZE = 1
 The estimated loss of base   2 significant digits is   3.68


 The root mean square relative error was    0.2248E-015 =    2 ** -51.98
 The estimated loss of base   2 significant digits is   1.02
