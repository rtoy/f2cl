1Test of J(X,ALPHA) vs Multiplication Theorem


   2000 Random arguments were tested from the interval ( 0.00, 2.00)


 J(X,ALPHA) was larger   669 times,
                agreed   684 times, and
           was smaller   647 times.


 There are  53 base   2 significant digits in a floating-point number


 The maximum relative error of    0.1002E-014 =    2 ** -49.83
    occurred for X =0.198094E+001 and NU =0.181940E-001
    with J(X,ALPHA) = 0.249289E+000
 The estimated loss of base   2 significant digits is   3.17


 The root mean square relative error was    0.2007E-015 =    2 ** -52.15
 The estimated loss of base   2 significant digits is   0.85

1Check of Error Returns


 The following summarizes calls with indicated parameters

 NCALC different from MB indicates some form of error

 See documentation for RJBESL for details

       ARG            ALPHA      MB      B(1)      NCALC


 0.1000000E+001 0.1500000E+001    5 0.0000000E+000   -1


 0.1000000E+001 0.5000000E+000   -5 0.0000000E+000   -6


 0.0000000E+000 0.1000000E+001    2 0.0000000E+000   -1

 Tests near the largest acceptable argument for RJBESL

 RJBESL will be called with the argument0.999878E+004
 NCALC returned the value    2
 and RJBESL returned U(1) = 0.630030E-002

 RJBESL will be called with the argument0.100012E+005
 This should trigger an error message.
 NCALC returned the value   -1
 and RJBESL returned U(1) = 0.000000E+000

 This concludes the tests.
