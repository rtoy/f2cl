1Test of Dawson's Integral vs Taylor expansion


   2000 Random arguments were tested from the interval ( 0.06, 1.00)


  F(X) was larger   521 times,
           agreed   997 times, and
      was smaller   482 times.


 There are  53 base   2 significant digits in a floating-point number


 The maximum relative error of    0.4301E-015 =    2 ** -51.05
    occurred for X =0.721184E+000
 The estimated loss of base   2 significant digits is   1.95


 The root mean square relative error was    0.1342E-015 =    2 ** -52.73
 The estimated loss of base   2 significant digits is   0.27
