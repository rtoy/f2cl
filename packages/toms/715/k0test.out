1Test of K0(X) vs Multiplication Theorem


   2000 random arguments were tested from the interval (  0.0,  1.0)


 ABS(K0(X)) was larger   535 times,
                     agreed  1044 times, and
                was smaller   421 times.


 There are  53 base   2 significant digits in a floating-point number.


 The maximum relative error of    0.6482E-015 =    2 ** -50.45
    occurred for X =0.988155E+000
 The estimated loss of base   2 significant digits is   2.55


 The root mean square relative error was    0.1264E-015 =    2 ** -52.81
 The estimated loss of base   2 significant digits is   0.19
