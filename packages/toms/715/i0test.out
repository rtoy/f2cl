1Test of I0(X) vs Multiplication Theorem


   2000 Random arguments were tested from the interval ( 0.00, 2.00)


 I0(X) was larger   539 times,
           agreed   952 times, and
      was smaller   509 times.


 There are  53 base   2 significant digits in a floating-point number


 The maximum relative error of    0.4436E-015 =    2 ** -51.00
    occurred for X =0.689108E-001
 The estimated loss of base   2 significant digits is   2.00


 The root mean square relative error was    0.1465E-015 =    2 ** -52.60
 The estimated loss of base   2 significant digits is   0.40

1Special Tests


 Test with extreme arguments

 I0(XMIN) = 0.10000000000000000E+001

 I0(0) = 0.10000000000000000E+001

 I0(-.55568624803404972E-001 ) = 0.10007721170120691E+001

 I0(0.55568624803404972E-001 ) = 0.10007721170120691E+001

 E**-X * I0(XMAX) = 0.29754474593158999E-154

 Tests near the largest argument for unscaled functions

 I0(0.69235094188622168E+003 ) = 0.73285657728857090E+299

 I0(0.73629899972079636E+003 ) = 0.17900000000000000E+309

 This concludes the tests.
