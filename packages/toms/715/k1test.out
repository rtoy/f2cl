1Test of K1(X) vs Multiplication Theorem


   2000 random arguments were tested from the interval (  0.0,  1.0)


 ABS(K1(X)) was larger   675 times,
                     agreed   686 times, and
                was smaller   639 times.


 There are  53 base   2 significant digits in a floating-point number.


 The maximum relative error of    0.6855E-015 =    2 ** -50.37
    occurred for X =0.957150E+000
 The estimated loss of base   2 significant digits is   2.63


 The root mean square relative error was    0.1804E-015 =    2 ** -52.30
 The estimated loss of base   2 significant digits is   0.70
