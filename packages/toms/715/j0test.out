1Test of J0(X) VS Taylor expansion


   2000 random arguments were tested from the interval (  0.0,  4.0)


 ABS(J0(X)) was larger   830 times
                agreed   642 times, and
           was smaller   528 times.


 There are  53 base   2 significant digits in a floating-point number.


 The maximum relative error of    0.1471E-014 =    2 ** -49.27
    occurred for X =0.243685E+001
 The estimated loss of base   2 significant digits is   3.73


 The root mean square relative error was    0.2129E-015 =    2 ** -52.06
 The estimated loss of base   2 significant digits is   0.94

 Test with extreme arguments



 J0 will be called with the argument 0.1797693135E+309
 This may stop execution.


 J0 returned the value 0.00000000000000000E+000

 This concludes the tests.
