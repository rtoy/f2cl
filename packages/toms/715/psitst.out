 Test of PSI(X) vs (PSI(X/2)+PSI(X/2+1/2))/2 + ln(2)


   2000 random arguments were tested from the interval (  0.0,  1.0)


 ABS(PSI(X)) was larger   579 times
                      agreed   703 times, and
                 was smaller   718 times.


 There are  53 base   2 significant digits in a floating-point number.


 The maximum relative error of    0.1004E-014 =    2 ** -49.82
    occurred for X =0.949543E+000
 The estimated loss of base   2 significant digits is   3.18


 The root mean square relative error was    0.2201E-015 =    2 ** -52.01
 The estimated loss of base   2 significant digits is   0.99
