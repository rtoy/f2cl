1                    subroutine hstplr example


          the output from the ncar control data 7600 was

                                ierror = 0
                  discretization error = 1.13038e-03
            required length of w array = 1042

          the output from your computer is

                                ierror = 0
                  discretization error = 0.11300E-02
            required length of w array =1042.
