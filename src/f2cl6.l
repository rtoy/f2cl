;; Suite of functions for replacing ".EQ.", ".AND." etc with "=", "AND" etc
;; as a preprocessor for fortran-to-lisp.
;; Numbers such as 6. are replaced with 6.0
;;                 .6                   0.6
;;                 -.6                  -0.6
;;                 6.D0                 6.0D0
;;  etc
;; Also replaces x.xE-x with x.xE~x and x.xE+x with x.xEx so that the lisp reader
;; when set to read FORTRAN can cope.
;; Replaces single quotes (') with double quotes (").

;; Comments are removed

;;; Some more number parsing bugs in PARSE-NUMBER.
;;; o d and e are valid exponent indicators and we missed them sometimes.
;;; o Add a few more comments
;;; o Make it easier to debug what parse-number would return as the

;;; Oops.  Remove that debugging statement.

;;; Revision 1.30  2002/02/07 20:35:22  rtoy
;;; Choose a better name than "prep.tmp" in whatever directory we are in
;;; for the temporary preprocessed file.  Make it go into the same
;;; directory as the Fortran file, but with the extension "p".
;;;
;;; Revision 1.29  2002/02/07 20:14:12  rtoy
;;; f2cl was incorrectly parsing
;;;
;;; 	character*10 dig
;;;
;;; as
;;;
;;; 	character * 10d ig
;;;
;;; because we weren't handling the case where the exponent character
;;; wasn't really an exponent character.
;;;
;;; Revision 1.28  2002/01/05 18:28:34  rtoy
;;; Was still erroneously doing an unread-char.  (Caught by Clisp.)
;;; Works with Clisp and CMUCL now, and probably others.

;;; Revision 1.27  2001/09/10 16:37:14  rtoy
;;; Oops.  Forgot to strip out the extra quote when we got quoted quotes
;;; in format strings.
;;;
;;; Revision 1.26  2001/09/10 16:21:39  rtoy
;;; Handle Fortran-style strings better by handling quoted quotes.  (In

;;; An attempt at handling Fortran Hollerith strings in FORMAT
;;; statements.  During preprocessing, look for a FORMAT statement and
;;; replace any Hollerith strings with real quoted strings.  (Can't do
;;; this for Hollerith in code because we don't have a real Fortran
;;; parser.)

;;;
;;; Revision 1.22  2001/06/04 14:06:03  rtoy
;;; Add *comment-line-characters* to hold a list of valid comment line
;;; characters.
;;;
;;; Revision 1.21  2000/09/01 14:07:37  rtoy
;;; In PARSE-NUMBER, we want to unread CHAR, but, according to the CLHS
;;; (and Clisp checks for this), unread-char must push back the last
;;; character that was read.  Because of SKIP-SPACES above, this CHAR is
;;; not necessarily the last character read anymore.  We have to modify
;;; the stream directly now.
;;;
;;; Revision 1.20  2000/08/18 15:22:11  rtoy
;;; Can't swallow blanks (for now) at the first part of parse-number
;;; because it causes things like "6.or." to become the symbol "6OR",
;;; which is wrong.
;;;
;;; Revision 1.19  2000/08/13 22:31:10  rtoy
;;; With the change in PARSE-NUMBER, ADJUST_NRS was sometimes messing up
;;; the columns for the statement number and the statement itself.  Fix
;;; this by having ADJUST_NRS alwasy read the first 6 characters of the
;;; line itself and interpreting the statement number instead of having
;;; PARSE-NUMBER do that.  Statement numbers are working again!
;;;
;;; Revision 1.18  2000/08/13 04:18:44  rtoy
;;; Make PARSE-NUMBER handle sapces within numbers, which is perfectly
;;; acceptable Fortran.  (May be a bit buggy still; probably should
;;; rewrite PARSE-NUMBER.)
;;;
;;; Revision 1.17  2000/08/01 23:02:36  rtoy
;;; We were messing up the printing of comments after we changed
;;; PREPROCESS to handle continuation lines.  We need to accumulate
;;; comment lines until we know we have a complete line (with all
;;; continuation lines).  Then we can print out the line followed by the
;;; accumulated comment lines.  This makes the comments possible out of
;;; sync with the generated Lisp code, but they were never really in sync
;;; anyway.
;;;
;;; Revision 1.16  2000/07/28 17:07:11  rtoy
;;; o We are in the f2cl package now.
;;; o When we preprocess the file, we want to READ using the F2CL package
;;;   so the symbols are in our package.  (I think that's what I want.)
;;;
;;; Revision 1.15  2000/07/27 16:39:17  rtoy
;;; We want to be in the CL-USER package, not the USER package.
;;;
;;; Revision 1.14  2000/07/21 21:15:17  rtoy
;;; Fix a typo in the punctuation list and add "/" to the list.
;;;
;;; Revision 1.13  2000/07/21 17:43:17  rtoy
;;; Need to be more careful about continuation lines.  We now leave a
;;; space between lines when concatenating them, except when the previous
;;; line ends with punctuation, or the current line begins with
;;; punctuation.  This is intended to handle cases like:
;;;
;;; 	double precision
;;;        & x
;;;
;;; from being converted to
;;;
;;; 	double precisionx
;;;
;;; which is wrong.  We want a space before the x.
;;;
;;; We want to handle these cases to, though:
;;;
;;; 	x = y .le
;;;        &. 42
;;;
;;; which shouldn't get a space between lines because we want "x = y
;;; .le. 42", not the invalid "x = y .le . 42".
;;;
;;; Revision 1.12  2000/07/13 16:55:34  rtoy
;;; To satisfy the Copyright statement, we have placed the RCS logs in
;;; each source file in f2cl.  (Hope this satisfies the copyright.)
