Fortran to Lisp Translation: installation instructions
------------------------------------------------------

1. Go to the f2cl source directory.
2. Use the target Common Lisp compiler to compile each of the files
   f2cl1.l through f2cl7.l and macros.l .
3. Edit the file f2cl0.l to reflect the root directory of the
   f2cl file system (*f2cl_dir*) and the extension for your Common
   Lisp compiled code (*ext*).
4. Load f2cl0.l into Common Lisp.
5. The translator functions are now available to be used.

6. Important note: when compiling or executing translated code the macros 
   in the file macros.l should be available.

For more information about f2cl, including user instructions, read the
article f2cldoc.* in the f2cl/doc directory or the tests in f2cl/val.
